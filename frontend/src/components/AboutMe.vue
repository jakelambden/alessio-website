            Alessio has now been tattooing since 2016. His work is highly influenced by the Renaissance era of the great
            artists of Florence in the 15th Century and other cultureâ€™s traditional art. Alessio thoroughly enjoys
            working on larger scale pieces, which are mostly black and grey. But his passion for art limits him to not
            one particular style.
